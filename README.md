FreePBX-AvantFAX
==================

Forked from FreepBX/helloworld as a base/jumping-off point.

This is a FreePBX really basic and probably crappy module that servers one purpose - to add a link to AvantFAX Web GUI for the IncredibleFAX/IncrediblePBX setup on Ubuntu14.  Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
